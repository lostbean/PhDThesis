Surface representation
----------------------

There many possible ways to represent finite surfaces with arbitrary
topology. Some of the most common methods will be describe and their
main advantages/disadvantages will be highlighted.

#### Polygon

The most simple and straightforward surface representation is the
polygon. A grain boundary can be represented by simple (non
self-intersecting) polygon where its vertexes, edges and internal area
correspond, respectively, to quadruple junctions, triple lines and the
grain boundary. Polygons are limited to represent flat grain boundaries
and straight triple lines.

#### Voxel

#### Marching cubes

#### NURBS
